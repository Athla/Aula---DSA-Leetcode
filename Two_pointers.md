# Two Pointers
- It's a algorithm used, mainly in the context of arrays, to solve problems that require to find a pair of elements that satisfy a certain condition.
- It has many variations and differnt implementations of the logic, each one changing accordingly to the problem faced.
- The core "variations" of this method are:
    - **Fixed Pointers**: When the pointers are fixed and the array is traversed.
    - **Sliding Window**: When the pointers are moved according to a condition.
    - **Two Sum**: When the pointers are used to find a pair of elements that sum up to a certain value.

- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
- It may change according to the problem faced, but it's oftenly O(n) or O(n log n).
